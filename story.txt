One day I was walking down Hauptstrasse when a Bratwurst fell fell onto my head from a window above.
A hund jumped from a schloss after the Bratwurst, tripping me, and disappeared into the distance.
I was just trying to see Rammstein play in the Beirgarten, I didn't think I was going to be assaulted by Bratwurst.
Suddenly a hot Apfelkuchen appeared. It was very effective. I don't know if it was the hot Apfelkuchen, the hund that tripped me, or the Rammstein I was missing but I suddenly had a craving for brot! 
At the time, I was working at a baeckerei.
I serve brot to Mathew and ran toward Richard; I found a bratwurst was broken into small pieces, yet Richard stood up like an iron man.
one day I was walking around town and saw a Hund drove a BMW straight into the store glass. I couldn't believe the audacity of the driver; at least let a Porsche crash into the store!
